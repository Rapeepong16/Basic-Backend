⚙️ What is Middleware?

Middleware is a function that sits between the incoming
request (req) and the outgoing response (res).

You can think of it like a “checkpoint” or “processing step”
that every request passes through before reaching the final destination

Client (sends request)
      ↓
[ Middleware 1 ] → does something → calls next()
      ↓
[ Middleware 2 ] → does something → calls next()
      ↓
[ Route handler (final response) ]
      ↓
Server sends response back to client

JSON.stringify()
When computer or web communicate that dont send 'object' or 'variable'
like source code but it is send only string.The data was sent only text.

Before:
const user = {
  name: "Bank",
  age: 22
};

After:
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(jsonString);

Output:
{"name":"Bank","age":22}
